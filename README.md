An Unofficial Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE) Client

### Synopsis

This is a NPM library can be used to retrieve trading information of the Philippine Stock Exchange. Information that can be retrieved by this library are symbols, company information, historical prices (with different resolutions). This is a node.js wrapper for the REST APIs from [PSE Tools](http://pse.tools/).

### Motivation

There isn't really a straightforward client library that I found to be helpful for retrieving stock market data for the Philippine Stock Exhange, so I decided to make one. Feel free to point me to an existing solution if you know one. I really don't want to reinvent the wheel if I don't have to.

### Disclaimer

As this is an *unofficial* client, this can stop working at any time the server will refuse traffic. I have no control over the server. If one day they wish to end access to their APIs, well I can't do anything about that.

The market data may not be accurate and I am not liable for any monetary loss, damages or loss of will to live that you may suffer as a result of your (bad) decisions based of the information you have retrieved using this library. I do not take any responsibility for what you do with this (and by extension, your life). **This is delivered as is and use at your own risk.**
